# BIT-Downloader
Being A DC Admin We guys have to fullfill all the request of downloading for fellow BITians , 
So i thought of automating this stuff and thus comes this project .

# Requiremnts
* Node Js > 6.3
* Express > 4
* Angular JS (most probably)

#To Do List

* Downlading videos from youtube
* If a direct downloading Link is given then use curl or wget to download the file
* Using multiple DC admin Users speed to increase performance 
* To update To Do list :P
